                 ★ CHANGELOG ★
----------------------------------------------------
➤ Updated Settings.ini file with new settings.
➤ Re‑added the “Copy Selected Text” feature (previously removed in the Saving Tabs update).
➤ Restored and rewrote several older features that were accidentally removed in the last update.
➤ Added a Discord RPC checkbox.
➤ Fully redesigned the Game Hub (for real this time).
➤ Slight settings color change (very subtle).
➤ Added outputs for the new checkbox and fixed older output issues.
➤ “Hidden” the Reset RPC button — it still exists, just not visible. Re‑checking the checkbox will reset RPC.
➤ Re‑added default editor text. If it’s your first time using the client and you have no tabs, it now defaults to this text.
➤ Faster animations for Settings and Client Selection.
➤ Settings saving is now functional (Settings.ini finally has a purpose).
